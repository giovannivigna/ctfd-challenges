description: |-
  This program prints an obfuscated flag (printable characters only) and asks you to enter the deobfuscated version.

  The catch: the provided binary is not x86_64. Run it under QEMU user-mode and debug it to recover the real flag.

  Suggested workflow:
  - Run normally: `qemu-riscv64 ./riskybehavior`
  - Debug: `qemu-riscv64 -g 1234 ./riskybehavior` then attach with `gdb-multiarch`
