description: |-
  A simple service that asks you for that other thing.
  Your input is checked by a deliberately annoying validation function.
  If correct, the service prints the contents of the flag file (/flag).

  Given to players: a statically linked compiled binary (with symbols, no source).
  Intended solve: use angr's symbolic execution engine to solve the validation function.
