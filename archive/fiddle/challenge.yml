  Fiddle is a challenge that shows the many ways in which data can be passed back and forth between a parent process and a child process.

  The service creates several file descriptors (shm, socketpair, pipes, memfd) and tells you which array index each one is stored at.

  Provide a message and a list of indices to route the message through; if the message is received correctly, you get the (encrypted) flag.
